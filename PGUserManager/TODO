* General:
  - Integrate Identity active checking in all queries
    . Identities must be considered hidden when active is false
  - Figure out how to do read only properties, there are whole bunches of stuff that i dont want people to be able to change ever
  - make all methods obey active status, except xx_query
  - Modify tests to be a bit more efficient
