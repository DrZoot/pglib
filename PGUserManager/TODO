* General:
  - Integrate Identity active checking in all queries
    . Identities must be considered hidden when active is false
  - Optimise uniqueness lookups in create functions to use get_by_key_name
  - If using key_names based on known values can get_x functions be modified to use get_by_key_name
    . get_by_key_name appears to be 2.6 less CPU intensive then equivalent fetch queries
  - Clean up the Exceptions, they're a bit scattershot
