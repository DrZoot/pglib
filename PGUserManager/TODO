* General:
  - Integrate Identity active checking in all queries
    . Identities must be considered hidden when active is false
  - Optimise uniqueness lookups in create functions to use get_by_key_name
  - If using key_names based on known values can get_x functions be modified to use get_by_key_name
    . get_by_key_name appears to be 2.6 less CPU intensive then equivalent fetch queries
  - Figure out how to do read only properties, there are whole bunches of stuff that i dont want people to be able to change ever
  - Normalise all incoming email address to lowercase, fairly sure key_names are case sensitive and that would be a pain
  - When inferring key_names for bindings use object.key().name() not the properties of the object
  - make all methods obey active status, except xx_query
  - Modify tests for has_permissions and has_members to include test inputs with some valid and some invalid members
